## Automated Data Analysis Project

This project automates the process of data analysis by loading datasets, generating charts, and producing insightful reports using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini. The project aims to analyze datasets, visualize key patterns, and summarize findings in a human-readable format. It can be used with any CSV dataset.

## Features

- **Dataset Loading**: The code can load datasets from CSV files, handling multiple encoding types.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates charts like correlation heatmaps and distributions for numeric data.
- **Automated Story Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to generate textual summaries and insights from the dataset.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically creates a `README.md` file summarizing the analysis results.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.7+
- `pandas` for data handling
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for chart generation
- `openai` Python package for interacting with the OpenAI API

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Hereâ€™s what `requirements.txt` should look like:

```txt
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
openai
```

## Configuration

Before running the project, you need to set up the OpenAI API key:

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   On Windows (Command Prompt):
   ```bash
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   On macOS/Linux (Bash):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

Alternatively, you can directly assign the key in the code (not recommended for production).

## Running the Project

1. Place your dataset files (e.g., `media.csv`, `happiness.csv`, `goodreads.csv`) in the same directory as the script or specify the full path.
2. Run the script with:

   ```bash
   python ab.py
   ```

   The script will process each dataset, generate charts, and create a report in the form of a `README.md` file.

### Example Output

After running the script, the following outputs will be generated:

- **Charts**: 
  - A correlation heatmap (`correlation_heatmap.png`)
  - Distribution plot for numeric data (`<column_name>_distribution.png`)
- **Reports**:
  - A `README.md` file summarizing the insights from the data generated by GPT-4o-mini.

## Code Structure

- **`ab.py`**: Main script that loads datasets, generates charts, and produces the final report.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file (this file).
- **`output/`**: Directory where generated charts and reports are saved.
